## Virtual Desktop Helper — Assists in using Virtual Desktops in Windows 10

This is based on the work of Markus Scholtes which can be found at https://github.com/MScholtes/VirtualDesktop

Added features:

 - System Tray icon which indicates which desktop you're on
 - Execute single-word shell commands (e.g. "/Execute:notepad.exe" will open it)
 - Commands can be typed into a form (double-click on the System Tray icon to see the form)
 - Context menu for the System Tray icon:
   - Add new virtual desktop
   - Remove this virtual desktop
   - Remove all other virtual desktops

# Enjoy!
